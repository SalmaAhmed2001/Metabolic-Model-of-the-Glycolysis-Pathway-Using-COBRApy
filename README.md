# Metabolic-Model-of-the-Glycolysis-Pathway-Using-COBRApy
The model includes a set of reactions and metabolites involved in the conversion of glucose to pyruvate

one of files returned an infeasible solution, which means that it was not possible to find a flux distribution that satisfies all the constraints.

another return visible soultion to optimize the production of pyruvate using the model.optimize() method.

i used escher for graph
